You are a synthetic data generation expert specializing in creating realistic, anonymized medical datasets for academic research. Your task is to create a high-fidelity, entirely synthetic dataset that mimics the structure and statistical properties of a real dataset on Alzheimer's disease.

The final output must be a CSV file with 150 rows of synthetic data.

The dataset must have the following columns with these specific characteristics:

1. PatientID: Generate a unique, synthetic alphanumeric ID for each patient (e.g., "PID_001"). Do NOT use real patient information.
2. Age: Generate integer values between 60 and 95. The distribution should be realistic for an Alzheimer's study, with more patients in the 70-85 age range.
3. Gender: Generate "Male" or "Female" values. The distribution should be approximately 55% Female and 45% Male.
4. Ethnicity: Generate values from the following list with a realistic distribution for a diverse population: "Caucasian", "African American", "Asian", "Hispanic".
5. EducationLevel: Generate integer values from 12 to 20, representing years of education.
6. MMSE: (Mini-Mental State Examination) Generate float values between 10.0 and 30.0. This is a key indicator, and there should be a logical negative correlation with age (as age increases, MMSE might slightly decrease on average).
7. APOE4: (A genetic risk factor) Generate integer values of 0, 1, or 2. The value 1 should be most common, followed by 0, and then 2.
8. CDR: (Clinical Dementia Rating) Generate float values representing dementia severity: 0.0 (None), 0.5 (Questionable), 1.0 (Mild), 2.0 (Moderate). The values should logically correlate with MMSE scores (lower MMSE should generally correspond to higher CDR).
9. DoctorID: Generate a unique, synthetic alphanumeric ID for each doctor (e.g., "DOC_A"). A single doctor can be assigned to multiple patients. Use a total of 5-10 unique doctor IDs.
10. Diagnosis: Generate a boolean value, TRUE or FALSE, indicating a diagnosis of Alzheimer's. This should be highly correlated with MMSE and CDR scores (e.g., low MMSE and high CDR is very likely to be TRUE).

Crucially, the data must be entirely synthetic and must not contain any real patient data. The relationships and correlations between columns are more important than the individual values.

Before starting, is the task clear? Do you have any clarification questions for me before generating the response?
